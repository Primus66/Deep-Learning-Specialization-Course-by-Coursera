  ##### Ans: 
- Sentiment classification (input a piece of text and output a 0/1 to denote positive or negative sentiment)
- Gender recognition from speech (input an audio clip and output a label indicating the speaker�s gender) 

  #### 4. You are training this RNN language model.

#### At the t^{th} time step, what is the RNN doing? Choose the best answer. 

  ##### Ans: Estimating P(y<t>|y<1>,y<2>,�,y<t-1>)

  #### 5. You have finished training a language model RNN and are using it to sample random sentences, as follows:
<img src="https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zOkWE_CvEee5Rg5IFJ7l8g_f36533d67eb6590d5bcb7021d88493eb_Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-5.58.53-PM.png?expiry=1563667200000&amp;hmac=91lnrYdvrGrLaJqa7Z_MRkQmC0Q4DFXSz6a2h2psdEE" alt="">
#### What are you doing at each time step t?

  ##### Ans: (i) Use the probabilities output by the RNN to randomly sample a chosen word for that time-step as y^<t>. (ii) Then pass this selected word to the next time-step.

  #### 6. You are training an RNN, and find that your weights and activations are all taking on the value of NaN (�Not a Number�). Which of these is the most likely cause of this problem?

  ##### Ans: Exploding gradient problem.

  #### 7. Suppose you are training a LSTM. You have a 10000 word vocabulary, and are using an LSTM with 100-dimensional activations a^{<t>}. What is the dimension of Gu at each time step?

  ##### Ans: 100

  #### 8. Here�re the update equations for the GRU.

#### Alice proposes to simplify the GRU by always removing the Gu. I.e., setting Gu = 1. Betty proposes to simplify the GRU by removing the Gr. I. e., setting Gr = 1 always. Which of these models is more likely to work without vanishing gradient problems even when trained on very long input sequences?

  ##### Ans: Betty�s model (removing Gr), because if Gu�0 for a timestep, the gradient can propagate back through that timestep without much decay. 

  #### 9. Here are the equations for the GRU and the LSTM:

#### From these, we can see that the Update Gate and Forget Gate in the LSTM play a role similar to _______ and ______ in the GRU. What should go in the the blanks?

  ##### Ans: Gu and 1-Gu

  #### 10. You have a pet dog whose mood is heavily dependent on the current and past few days� weather. You�ve collected data for the past 365 days on the weather, which you represent as a sequence as x<1>,�,x<365>. You�ve also collected data on your dog�s mood, which you represent as y<1>,�,y<365>. You�d like to build a model to map from x?yx \rightarrow yx?y. Should you use a Unidirectional RNN or Bidirectional RNN for this problem?
##### Ans: Unidirectional RNN, because the value of y<t>y^{<t>}y<t> depends only on x<1>,�,x<t>, but not on x<t+1>,�,x<365>

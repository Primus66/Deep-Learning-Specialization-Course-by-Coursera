#### 1. What do you think applying this filter to a grayscale image will do?
```
   | 0 1 -1  0 | 
   | 1 3 -3 -1 |
   | 1 3 -3 -1 |
   | 0 1 -1  0 |
#### Ans: Detect vertical edges
#### 2. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you are not using a convolutional network. If the first hidden layer has 100 neurons, each one fully connected to the input, how many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)? 
#### Ans: 27,000,100 
```
300*300*3 + 100(bias)
```
#### 3. Suppose your input is a 300 by 300 color (RGB) image, and you use a convolutional layer with 100 filters that are each 5x5. How many parameters does this hidden layer have (including the bias parameters)?
#### Ans: 7600
```
(W * H * C_in + 1) * C_out
```
#### 4. You have an input volume that is 63x63x16, and convolve it with 32 filters that are each 7x7, using a stride of 2 and no padding. What is the output volume? 
#### Ans: 29x29x32 
```
((n - f)/2 + 1, (n - f)/2 + 1, filters)
```
#### 5. You have an input volume that is 15x15x8, and pad it using �pad=2.� What is the dimension of the resulting volume (after padding)?
#### Ans: 19x19x8
```
n + 2p
```
#### 6. You have an input volume that is 63x63x16, and convolve it with 32 filters that are each 7x7, and stride of 1. You want to use a �same� convolution. What is the padding?
#### Ans: 3
```
((n + 2p - f)/s + 1) = n
```
#### 7. You have an input volume that is 32x32x16, and apply max pooling with a stride of 2 and a filter size of 2. What is the output volume?
#### Ans: 16x16x16
#### 8. Because pooling layers do not have parameters, they do not affect the backpropagation (derivatives) calculation.
#### Ans: False
#### 9. In lecture we talked about �parameter sharing� as a benefit of using convolutional networks. Which of the following statements about parameter sharing in ConvNets are true? (Check all that apply.)
#### Ans: 
- It allows a feature detector to be used in multiple locations throughout the whole input image/input volume.
- It reduces the total number of parameters, thus reducing overfitting.
#### 10. In lecture we talked about �sparsity of connections� as a benefit of using convolutional layers. What does this mean?
#### Ans: Each activation in the next layer depends on only a small number of activations from the previous layer.
